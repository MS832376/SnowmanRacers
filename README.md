# Snowman Races
Repository for Team A Project 2

In this platformer you play a snowman that is trying to get to the gifts before anyone else.

Along the way you will have to traverse treachorous terrain like lava pools and pits, and avoid nasty monsters like the nutcracker.
If you fail to avoid these obstacles, your snowman will spawn back at the beginning and you'll have to start all over!
You better be quick too, because once the first player finishes the level you only have 30 seconds to reach the end!

Snowman Races is a multiplayer platformer that times the players and lists their placements and times once everyone has finished or time has run out.
To start playing a player need only enter their name and click "Play" to be randomly placed into an open room.
The multiplayer room is open until the room master clicks on a level to start, then the room is closed until players return to the lobby.
If no rooms are currently open, the player will be placed into their own room.
If players so desire, they can also manually create their own room by clicking "Make Own Room." 
This also will help prevent anyone from notbeing able to play due to a room leader that will not start the game.
