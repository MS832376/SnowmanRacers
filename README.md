# Snowman Racers
Repository for Team A Project 2

Snowman Racers is a 2D multiplayer platformer set in a Winter Wonderland.
You play as a snowman! Racing, to get to the finish line before your snowman brothers. 
Watch out for those bottomless pits and lava pools along the way! They're super dangerous!
You'll be wearing the green hat, while your brothers will wear the red.
Upon completion of the race a leaderboard will pop up with everyone's times, if you race through the entire gme it will show everyone's total times.
Run, jump, and climb your way to victory in this fun Platformer Royale!

This game qualifies as complex because of Photon, even if we added nothing else to the game. 
Through photon we tackled many complex issues, such as making the local snowman's hat green while the others were red.
We also had to somehow sync up the leaderboard to appropriately display for all parties the same way.
Also counting up the total time it took for everyone to complete all the levels, and displaying the same final number was complex.
Calculating a DNF qualifier also posed many issues, such as not updating the leaderboard, not deleting the DNF snowmen while still allowing their users to control them,
and simply breaking the game.
